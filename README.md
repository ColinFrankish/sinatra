This was the first attempt at using Sinatra to build a basic web application.

Using just 2 Gems - 'Sinatra' and 'Shotgun' - to quickly launch an app and to practise
the use of 'erb' (embedded Ruby) with some simple HTML and CSS. 

As well as the Ruby/erb coding, some effort was made to give the simple site some basic
interactive features. Extra styling was added after the original project for practice.


`````shell
Launch using command 'shotgun hello.rb' from the command line
Open a local-host in the first instance to see the app - use port 9393
`````
