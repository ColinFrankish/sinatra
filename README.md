This was the first attempt at using Sinatra to build a basic web application.

Using just 2 Gems - 'Sinatra' and 'Shotgun' - to quickly launch an app and to practise
the use of 'erb' (embedded Ruby) with some simple HTML and CSS. 

As well as the Ruby coding, some effort was made to give the simple site some basic
interactive features.


`````shell
Launch using command 'shotgun hello.rb' from the command line
Open a local-host in the first instance to see the app - use port 9393
`````
